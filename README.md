<h2>Installation</h2>

`pip install hypertools`

or

To install from this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools.git`

Then, navigate to the folder and type:

`pip install -e .`

(this assumes you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed on your system)

<h2>Requirements</h2>

+ python 2.7, 3.4+
+ PPCA>=0.0.2

<h3>Submitting a bug report</h3>
If you are reporting a bug, please do your best to include the following -

1. A short, top-level summary of the bug. In most cases, this should be 1-2 sentences.
2. A short, self-contained code snippet to reproduce the bug, ideally allowing a simple copy and paste to reproduce. Please do your best to reduce the code snippet to the minimum required.
3. The actual outcome of the code snippet
4. The expected outcome of the code snippet

<h3>Contributing code</h3>

The preferred way to contribute to HyperTools is to fork the main repository on GitHub, then submit a pull request.

+ If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the title to describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description to ensure a link is created to the original issue.

+ All public methods should be documented in the README.

+ Each high-level plotting function should have a simple example in the examples folder. This should be as simple as possible to demonstrate the method.

+ Changes (both new features and bugfixes) should be tested using `pytest`.  Add tests for your new feature to the `tests/` repo folder.
