    "An egg is made up of (at minimum) the stimuli presented to a subject and the stimuli recalled by the subject.  With these, two components we can perform a number of analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recall Accuracy** - the proportion of stimuli presented that were later recalled\n",
    "2. **Serial Position Curve** - recall accuracy as a function of the encoding position of the stimulus\n",
    "3. **Probability of First Recall** - the probability that a stimulus will be recalled first as a function of its encoding position\n",
    "4. **Lag-CRP** - given the recall of word n, the probability of recalling stimuli at neighboring positions (n+/-1, 2, 3 etc).\n",
    "5. **Temporal Clustering** - a measure of recall clustering by temporal proximity during encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a set of features for the stimuli, we can also compute a **Memory Fingerprint**, which is an estimate of how a subject clusters their recall responses with respect to features of a stimulus (see the fingerprint tutorial for more on this).\n",

Similarly, if after you recall \"cat\" you recall the word \"can\", your clustering by starting letter score would increase, since both words share the first letter \"c\".  This logic can be extended to any number of feature dimensions.\n",
