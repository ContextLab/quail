    "1. **Recall Accuracy** - the proportion of words presented that were later recalled\n",
    "2. **Serial Position Curve** - recall accuracy as a function of the encoding position of the word\n",
    "3. **Probability of First Recall** - the probability that a word will be recalled first as a function of its encoding position\n",
    "4. **Lag-CRP** - given the recall of word n, the probability of recalling words at neighboring positions (n+/-1, 2, 3 etc).\n",
    "5. **Temporal Clustering** - a measure of recall clustering by temporal proximity during encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a set of features for the stimuli, we can also compute a **Memory Fingerprint**, which is an estimate of how a subject clusters their recall responses with respect to features of a stimulus (see the fingerprint tutorial for more on this).\n",

For example, if you recall \"dog\", and then the next word you recall is \"cat\", your clustering by category score would increase because the two recalled words are in the same category.  Similarly, if after you recall \"cat\" you recall the word \"can\", your clustering by starting letter score would increase, since both words share the first letter \"c\".  This logic can be extended to any number of feature dimensions.\n",
