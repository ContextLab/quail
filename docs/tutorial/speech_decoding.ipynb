    "## Automated Speech Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical free recall experiment, after the experiment completes the experimenter (or a team of experience-hungry undergraduates) will manually transcribe the verbal responses from a subject by listening to audio files, and coding each word.  This process can take hours, and is typically not exciting, to say the least. To help with this problem, we created a `decode_speech` function, which wraps the Google Speech API and a software package called `ffmpeg` to automatically transcribe the responses. Furthermore, it allows the experimenter to transcribe in (almost) realtime, which makes adaptive free recall experiments a possibility. To use this feature (assuming that you are using a mac or linux machine), you must first set up ffmpeg and Google Speech API:"

Up to 60 minutes/month is free, and after that it costs \\$0.006 per 15 seconds. For a typical study (16 study/test blocks) allowing for a minute of recall after each, the price comes out to ~$0.38 per subject. To set it up, follow these steps:\n",
