    "This tutorial will go over the basics of the `Egg` data object, the essential quail data structure that contains all the data you need to run analyses and plot the results. An egg is made up of two primary pieces of data: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `pres` data - words/stimuli that were presented to a subject\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `rec` data - words/stimuli that were recalled by the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot create an egg without both of these components.  Additionally, there are a few optional fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `features` data - features that describe each of the stimuli (for example, the category of the word, word length, etc.). This field is required for fingerprint analysis (see the fingerprint tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `dist_funcs` dictionary - this field allows you to control the distance functions for each of the stimulus features.  For more on this, see the fingerprint tutorial.\n",
    "\n",

    "As described in the fingerprint tutorial, the `features` data structure is used to estimate how subjects cluster their recall responses with respect to the features of the encoded stimuli.  Briefly, these estimates are derived by computing the similarity of neighboring recall words along each feature dimension.  For example, if you recall \"dog\", and then the next word you recall is \"cat\", your clustering by category score would increase because the two recalled words are in the same category.  Similarly, if after you recall \"cat\" you recall the word \"can\", your clustering by starting letter score would increase, since both words share the first letter \"c\".  This logic can be extended to any number of feature dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity between the words can be computed in a number of ways.  By default, the distance function for all textual features (like category, starting letter) is binary.  In other words, if the words are in the same category (cat, dog), there similarity would be 1, whereas if they are in different categories (cat, can) their similarity would be 0.  For numerical features (such as word length), by default similarity between words is computed using Euclidean distance.  However, the point of this digression is that you can define your own distance functions by passing a `dist_func` dictionary to the `Egg` class.  This could be for all feature dimensions, or only a subset. Let's see an example:"
